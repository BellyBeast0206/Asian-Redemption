# Asian Redemption

## Introduction
Asian Redemption is a project dedicated to exploring the demographic trends and rising populations of Japanese and South Koreans. It aims to highlight the socio-economic implications of these demographic shifts and their impact on regional and global contexts.

## Key Features
- **Population Growth Analysis:** Detailed analysis of the population growth trends in Japan and South Korea.
- **Comparative Studies:** Comparative studies between the demographic patterns of Japanese and South Korean populations.
- **Impact Assessment:** Assessment of the impact of population growth on various sectors such as economy, healthcare, and social dynamics.

## C++ Population Growth Simulator

### Overview
The C++ code provided simulates population growth based on specified parameters such as birth rate, death rate, and migration rate. This simulation helps in understanding how changes in these factors can influence population trends over time.

### Code Snippet
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int currentPopulation = 126500000; // Japan's current population
    double birthRate = 0.008; // Birth rate per year
    double deathRate = 0.01; // Death rate per year
    double migrationRate = 0.0005; // Net migration rate per year

    int years = 20; // Simulation duration

    for (int i = 1; i <= years; ++i) {
        int births = currentPopulation * birthRate;
        int deaths = currentPopulation * deathRate;
        int netMigration = currentPopulation * migrationRate;

        currentPopulation = currentPopulation + births - deaths + netMigration;

        cout << "Year " << i << ": Population = " << currentPopulation << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
